## Accomplished tasks

We have successfully implemented tasks 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. In addition, we attempted to implement task 4.4, which is encapsulated in the file readSVG.cpp. Unfortunately, this implementation did not function as expected. Also, to help improve code readability, we have also added comments in Doxygen style throughout the code, providing a detailed explanation of the logic and functionality behind each section.

More about the task 4.1. We implemented all new classes as subclasses of SVGElement. Used draw_ellipse for ellipses and circle, draw_polygon for polygon and rect, draw_line for polyline and line.
